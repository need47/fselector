Synopsis
--------

FSelector is a Ruby gem that aims to integrate various feature 
selection/ranking algorithms and related functions into one single 
package. Welcome to contact me (need47@gmail.com) if you'd like to 
contribute your own algorithms or report a bug. FSelector allows user 
to perform feature selection by using either a single algorithm or an 
ensemble of multiple algorithms, and other common tasks including 
normalization and discretization on continuous data, as well as replace 
missing feature values with certain criterion. FSelector acts on a 
full-feature data set in either CSV, LibSVM or WEKA file format and 
outputs a reduced data set with only selected subset of features, which 
can later be used as the input for various machine learning softwares 
such as LibSVM and WEKA. FSelector, as a collection of filter methods, 
does not implement any classifier like support vector machines or 
random forest. See below for a list of FSelector's features and 
{file:ChangeLog} for updates.

  there are two types of filter methods, i.e., feature weighting algorithms and feature subset selection algorithms  
  
  - for weighting type: use either **select\_feature\_by\_score!** or **select\_feature\_by\_rank!**  
  - for subset type: use **select\_feature!**

**3. feature selection approaches**

 - by a single algorithm
 - by multiple algorithms in a tandem manner
 - by multiple algorithms in an ensemble manner (share the same feature selection interface as single algorithm)

Installing
----------

To install FSelector, use the following command:

    $ gem install fselector
    
  **note:** From version 0.5.0, FSelector uses the RinRuby gem (http://rinruby.ddahl.org) 
  as a seemless bridge to access the statistical routines in the R package (http://www.r-project.org), 
  which will greatly expand the inclusion of algorithms to FSelector, especially for those relying 
  on statistical test. To this end, please pre-install the R package. RinRuby should have been 
  auto-installed with FSelector via the above command.
  
Usage
-----

**1. feature selection by a single algorithm**

    require 'fselector'
	
    # use InformationGain (IG) as a feature selection algorithm
    r1 = FSelector::IG.new
    
    # read from random data (or csv, libsvm, weka ARFF file)
    # no. of samples: 100
    # no. of classes: 2
    # no. of features: 15
    # no. of possible values for each feature: 3
    # allow missing values: true
    r1.data_from_random(100, 2, 15, 3, true)
    
    # number of features before feature selection
    puts "  # features (before): "+ r1.get_features.size.to_s
    
    # select the top-ranked features with scores >0.01
    r1.select_feature_by_score!('>0.01')
    
    # number of features after feature selection
    puts "  # features (after): "+ r1.get_features.size.to_s
    
    # you can also use a second alogirithm for further feature selection
    # e.g. use the ChiSquaredTest (CHI) with Yates' continuity correction
    # initialize from r1's data
    r2 = FSelector::CHI.new(:yates, r1.get_data)
    
    # number of features before feature selection
    puts "  # features (before): "+ r2.get_features.size.to_s
    
    # select the top-ranked 3 features
    r2.select_feature_by_rank!('<=3')
    
    # number of features after feature selection
    puts "  # features (after): "+ r2.get_features.size.to_s
    
    # save data to standard ouput as a weka ARFF file (sparse format)
    # with selected features only
    r2.data_to_weka(:stdout, :sparse)

	
**2. feature selection by an ensemble of multiple feature selectors**

    require 'fselector'
	
	# example 1
	#
	
	
	# creating an ensemble of feature selectors by using 
	# a single feature selection algorithm (INTERACT) 
	# by instance perturbation (e.g. random sampling)
	
	# test for the type of feature subset selection algorithms
    r = FSelector::INTERACT.new(0.0001)

    # an ensemble of 40 feature selectors with 90% data by random sampling
    re = FSelector::EnsembleSingle.new(r, 40, 0.90, :random_sampling)

    # read SPECT data set  (under the test/ directory)
    re.data_from_csv('test/SPECT_train.csv')

    # number of features before feature selection
    puts '  # features (before): ' + re.get_features.size.to_s

    # only features with above average count among ensemble are selected
    re.select_feature!

    # number of features after feature selection
    puts '  # features before (after): ' + re.get_features.size.to_s

    
    # example 2
	#
	
	
	# creating an ensemble of feature selectors by using 
	# two feature selection algorithms: InformationGain (IG) and Relief_d. 
	# note: can be 2+ algorithms, as long as they are of the same type, 
	# either feature weighting or feature subset selection algorithms
	
	# test for the type of feature weighting algorithms 
    r1 = FSelector::IG.new
    r2 = FSelector::Relief_d.new(10)
    
    # an ensemble of two feature selectors
    re = FSelector::EnsembleMultiple.new(r1, r2)
    
    # read random discrete data (containing missing value)
    re.data_from_random(100, 2, 15, 3, true)
    
    # replace missing value because Relief_d 
    # does not allow missing value
    re.replace_by_most_seen_value!
    
    # number of features before feature selection
    puts '  # features (before): ' + re.get_features.size.to_s
    
    # based on the max feature score (z-score standardized) among
    # an ensemble of feature selectors
    re.ensemble_by_score(:by_max, :by_zscore)
    
    # select the top-ranked 3 features
    re.select_feature_by_rank!('<=3')
    
    # number of features after feature selection
    puts '  # features (after): ' + re.get_features.size.to_s
    
**3. feature selection after discretization**
 
    require 'fselector'
    
    # the Information Gain (IG) algorithm requires data with discrete feature
    r = FSelector::IG.new
    
    # but the Iris data set contains continuous features
    r.data_from_url('http://repository.seasr.org/Datasets/UCI/arff/iris.arff', :weka)
        
    # let's first discretize it by ChiMerge algorithm at alpha=0.10
    # then perform feature selection as usual
    r.discretize_by_ChiMerge!(0.10)
    
    # number of features before feature selection
    puts '  # features (before): ' + r.get_features.size.to_s
    
    # select the top-ranked feature
    r.select_feature_by_rank!('<=1')
    
    # number of features after feature selection
    puts '  # features (after): ' + r.get_features.size.to_s
